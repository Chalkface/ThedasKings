Blight System


"Things are slowly getting back to normal in most parts of the country, but Lothering is gone for good. We had hoped to
rebuild there, but the Blight poisoned the land. It'll take decades for the earth to recover. It may never."
 - Letter from Miriam to Leadra Hawke, 9:34 Dragon
 
 
The means to which the Darkspawn interact with the world. Darkspawn are always a threat, always on the prowl, though they
are governed in danger by a global modifier level. They will raid villages, prowl around the outskirts of civilisation and
require Grey Wardens to visit your lands. Upon the trigger of a Blight, the Darkspawn will rise up and unify into a single
Empire, and march upon the land. Every area they conquer is rendered near useless blight lands and every character who
can't escape is killed by the horde. The Blight will not end the game for any player, unless their entire dynasty is
massacred in one foul swoop (hope not), but the destruction and chaos caused to all is a complete show stopper for all
petty intrigue. This period is dangerous for more reasons than just the Darkspawn, as until the Blight is confirmed and
widely accepted, many will see it as a good opportunity to power grab. There will also be a large number of characters
forcibly recruited by Grey Wardens, as they focus on battling the threat of the blight. After the archdemon is killed, the
horde breaks apart and the war ends. For a period after the Blight, the Waning means that even the recovery period is
volatile but gradually the number of events go down.

A small system, but the sheer scale and turbulence of the events make it a game changer.
