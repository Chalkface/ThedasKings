Thedas Kings
============

Hello and welcome to the code hub for Thedas Kings! This site may look a little complicated, but thankfully it is extremely convenient and user friendly once you find your way around.

After creating an account and having been accepted as a contributor, please click on drop down menu just above the files, where it says "branch:master".

Type in your name and current task into the box to distinguish your branch and hit enter. This will copy the master files into your separate branch of the mod. Here you can edit files as you wish without disrupting anyone else or the original files. PLEASE STICK TO YOUR OWN FILES out of courtesy, unless the branch owner is aware and cool with changes made. Whenever someone makes an edit it will be logged, so if you are concerned that someone has edited your files without your consent, you can click the # commits button above the branch:master to check.

You can quickly look at and compare your work to any other contributors branch using the green "Compare and Review" button, so you can see if anyone elses work overlaps with your own. Clicking on the 'Network' tab on the sidebar to the right of the main page will allow you to quickly review what changes have been made in all branches of the mod - at the moment you can see that I created a branch and added a TEST file.

Inside your branch, you can create new files by using the icon to the right of Thedas-Kings. This little icon works within any subfolder as well. Should you need to create any new folders, simply type the folder name followed by / into the file name textbox, and it will automatically create the folder for you to use, so long as there is a file inside it.

You can also create files in notepad++ and copy paste them over to the site once they are done. I recommend that you update your branch with any changes you make after a session of working, so that we can see how often you are updating your code. You don't need to make it all perfect until you publish it, don't worry!

Extra details:
> If you are working on Events or Localisation .txt files, please distinguish your file as to what is inside it. Every text file in those folders is read by the game, so you can have events in different files depening on what they are related too, eg: Qunari, Marriage, ect. We would rather have a lot of specific event documents than a single file with 600 events.

> If you wish to add non text files to the game, you will have to download the github software. I will help case by case, but the basics of it is: Open Github application, sign in. On the github site, click on your branch and put "Clone in desktop." Inside your software, you should not have a copy of the mod. Clock on the local repository, click on the cog in the corner, open in explorer. Put your files in that folder where you want them to be, refresh, then commit changes and sync. It should update your github branch with the new files. If this doesn't work, ask me or anyone in the team who knows how to use github for help.

Alright, so you have your files ready for integration into the rest of the mod. Firstly, if your changes are small and you are going to continue with something similar (for example, if you finish a few events and you are going to do some more), then feel free to just let us know you are done with a section and move on. Otherwise, click on Pull Request. This allows you to draft a merger between your files and the master files by selecting your branch and the master branch. I will be pinged and we can make sure that everything is kosher before accepting the edit.


Finally if you have any questions, have found any bugs, duplicates ect, you can either contact someone else in the team directly over steam or you can raise it generally from the "Issues" tab on the right. Once the mod is operational, we will be relying on this section to bugfix releases, but for now it is still useful. Feel free to add ideas or larger discussions to the built in wiki on the right for group conversation.
