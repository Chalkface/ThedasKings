crown;Crown Style;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_desc;The Human Kingdoms of Thedas are organised along the sliding scale of Crown Authority against Noble Authority. Each flavour of rule offers different traits and opportunities for both parties, and changes the way the landsmeet operates fundamentally, meaning that the politics of one realm may be completely different to the situation in it's neighbours. To switch to a more favourable system is indeed possible, but would always require either a complete surrender or a military defeat to force through. No King or group of Nobles would be willing to sign it's rights away without a fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_0;Antivan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_0_desc;The Antivan Monarchy is considered the weakest power in Thedas. By it's people it is regardless held as a jewel to be treasured and protected, and that the rightful candidate is sitting upon the throne is a very urgent topic of discussion amongst the land upon succession. The ancient dynasties that rule these lands are considered thus an essential part of the realm's pride, but there their practical importance ends. In Antiva, the Merchants rule the city, and in any similar system the nobles can claim the same amount of power. Faction Leaders govern foreign politics, domestic affairs, issues and the succession by ruthlessly pursuing a path that grants them the most power and respect. Perhaps this is why Antiva is so very bloody: to be on top of Antivan Politics is to be a King in all but name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_1;Marcher;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_1_desc;The Free Marches are a ragtag group of city states and dynasties fighting for short term dominance first, and the glory of their city second. Ruled by Kings, Teyrns, Viscomtes and whatever else tradition demands, rulers of the Marches are always the most powerful noble houses around. These Dynasties cultivate longevity by amassing wide dynasties of talented individuals, and steadily killing off the ones who would complicate the flow of power, right under the nose of the vultures that watch intently from the streets. Marcher politics is a test of patience and intrigue, with the lesser houses always preparing, always ready to swoop in at the right moment and butcher everyone between them and the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_2;Fereldan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_2_desc;The Landsmeet is an ancient Tradition of Ferelden that has it's origins in the acknowledgement of both Crown and Nobility that one cannot survive without the co-operation of the other. Here the state aims for a pure balance between the two sides. The Monarchy is a precious thing, but the particular figure whom is on the throne is not, and they must earn the respect of the nobility in order to be placed in power and to continue to weild it effectively. The nobles for their part still bicker amongst themselves, but they struggle to assemble blocks of power to guide their views into the debating halls, rather than stabbing each other in the dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_3;Tevinter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_3_desc;In Tevinter, the Archon wields ultimate power. The Senate is a council, a soundboard to see who might object to what law being passed and why, and most importantly the method of picking a successor. All are capable of being selected for the position regardless of dynasty or claim, although with so many Magisters vying for a single spot, it helps to be powerful, influential and charismatic. The nobles will wage a war as much about prestige as it is about a genocidal rampage through the competition, all in order to prove they are the obvious candidate for the spot. After all, once you finally reach the position of Archon the only limit you have is how much you can get away with without being killed in your sleep, a concern only to familiar to the veterans of Senate Politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_4;Orlesian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
crown_4_desc;The Orlesian Monarchy is one of the most modern states in the world in some ways. As long as a millennia ago its earliest Emperors realised that the scheming of lesser men would damage the stability and position of the nation, and so the art of  domestic politics has been reduced to a simple game. The ingenious nature of the Grand Game means that all an Orlesian Monarch has to worry about in this day and age is civil war or outright rebellion against their dynasty, as nobles now fight for mere prestige and meaningless titles - as opposed to genuine power. Protected by laws of Primogeniture and a tradition of the supreme authority of the Emperor over all others, the ruler is free to conduct affairs like a father watching over his bickering children. This is as absolute as power can get in Thedas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry;Chantry Authority;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_desc;The Authority of the Divine is never set in stone, relying mainly on the respect and devotion of the realm in question to their authority. Here, the Divine must wield her power through agents, the Templars or the Seekers, rather than her own actions and words. She delegates, cherry picks who should be wielding her authority and where, in order to influence the world, but ultimately cannot enforce that power over the unwilling until they outright break the Chantry vows, or utterly offend her other subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_0;Minimal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_0_desc;This realm is purposefully limiting it's exposure to the divines influence, and her agents are restricted to Bards and Inquisitors who can sneak into the land. The Chantry can watch what happens here, just about, but it no longer has any say over the flock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_1;Weak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_1_desc;The authority of the Divine has been reduced to a series of strongly worded letters, rather than real power. The Grand Cleric is now chosen by the King and send to the Divine to be accepted, which she will rarely refuse. Aside from specific duties, the Templar Order now is heavily restricted in their activities and influence across the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_2;Moderate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_2_desc;The traditional balance of power. The Divine watches, carefully, and her Grand Cleric is selected purposefully for her role in influencing the realm as the Divine may wish. The flock is shepherded appropriately, and the Templars are allowed their traditionally free reign in their sacred tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
chantry_3;Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_3_desc;Many look to the Divine and the Grand Cleric rather than to their secular lords for judgement, and the rights of the Chantry are cemented in law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_4;Integral;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chantry_4_desc;The devotion of the flock and their secular rulers is such that they willingly kneel to the Divines guidance. The power wielded by her arms is given preferential treatment, the Templars in particular are unleashed from their reigns to expand their purview and power across the entire realm as their commander may see fit. However, such a level of oversight might not even be desired by the Divine, depending on whether she views herself as a Shepherd or an Exemplar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
