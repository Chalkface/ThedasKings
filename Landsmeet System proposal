LANDSMEET SYSTEM

"For five years Anora has been queen, and proven herself worthy of the Therin name. She can lead our people through this
crisis, and I can lead her armies. My lords and ladies, our land has been threatened before. It's been invaded, and lost,
and won times beyond counting. We Ferelndans have proven that we will never truly be conquered so long as we are united.
We must not let ourselves be divided now. Stand with me, and we shall defeat even the Blight itself!"
 - Teyrn Loghain, 9:31 Dragon

[Five Seconds later]

"Traitors! Which of you stood against the Orlesian Emperor when his troops flattened your fields and raped your wives?
You fought with us once, Eamon. You cared about this land once. Before you got too old and fat and content to even see
what you risk. None of you deserve a say in what happens here! None of you have spilled blood for this land the way I have!
How DARE you judge me!"
 - Teyrn Loghain 9:31 Dragon



The Landsmeet System is the game that Lords play once they have scrambled their way to the top tiers of their Kingdoms
political ladder. The King, his council and the most prestigious of the realm landowners have in this their own private
arena to decide, ideally, matters of state. More realistically, they now have a much higher stakes game of petty intrigue
to play, pitting them against other and the Monarch in their quest to be at the top of the ladder - almost coincidently
directing the realm through various political crises in the process. All matters of state, the monarch and international
politics are run through this system and provide matters for debate and intrigue, ranging from minor nobles raising an
issue in front of the realm to full blown civil war over claimants to the throne.

Edit: A situation we don't want is the Monarch being overwhelmed with constant revolts by their vassals, as people quite
rightly get very annoyed by having to micro vassal opinions constantly. This is why the King in most systems only needs a
foundation of support to be okay. In all war they will have their crown loyalist allies, and if they have a second source
of help they aren't going to be easy to crack. But they also can't be hard to destabilise, nor remain stable forever.
They also may be able to survive with little, but to do everything they want, that requires more support to pull off.
It's going to take a lot of balancing.


To this end, the focus is upon:
	Providing the player with a challenge to reach, an obstacle to clear and a set of characters to manage as Monarch.
	Restricting the power of the Monarch both systematically via domestic policy, and randomly via Faction Leaders.
	Allowing the realm to be destabilised, without removing the opportunity for stability.
	Tiering the most prestigious away from the general mass, providing four faces to remember instead of sixty.
	Earning minor titles... but BETTER ones. What? No-one is going to turn down a title that comes with taxation rights.

PRIMARY COMPONENTS:

TRACKED CHARACTERS:
	Monarch
	Monarch Spouse (If Powerful)
	Regent (If in place)
	Councillors
		Diplomat
		Marshal
		Intrigue
		Steward
		Grey Warden Advisor
		Grand Cleric
	All Four Personality Faction Leaders

All Tracked Characters may be approached by outside influences to lobby for a certain change to be made a la Crown or
Domestic laws, or international relations. This gives the 12 around the Monarch the ability to act treacherously for
profit and cause scandal.
	
NOTABLE REALM NOBLES:
The four most prestigious members of the realm are elevated to faction leaders in court, and maintenance events ensure
unpopular or incapable members are replaced by new ones to keep the factions balanced and powerful.

LOBBYING OF MINOR LORDS
A method of lobbying by smaller lords, who may aim to turn a Faction leader onto the issue of their choice, or have them
speak out in favour of their smaller cases. They may also ask for a political alliance to support their own faction.

Minor Lords may start their own factions aimed at a specific issue, but these are dependant on the support of either the
majority of the Minor Lordlings or on other faction leaders. They are vulnerable to petty scheming and the whims of
the 13 Tracked Characters.

SLIGHTLY LESS PETTY POLITICS
The Tracked Characters, particularly the King and the Four Factions, are vulnerable to Political Debates. These high cousins
of petty squabbles are basically spats between the participants, which are very dangerous but also very rewarding. To be
at the top is a profitable venture, but only one can be there. Depending on the Domestic Policy, either the King, the
Faction Leaders or neither have an advantage. This is tracked through the Kings Authority modifier on his sheet, vs the
Political Standing of the Faction Leaders, plus each factions strength.

ISSUE POLITICS
When an issue faction reaches a certain power base, or acquires a powerful enough ally, the game will trigger an event where
the case is presented at court for the consideration of all members of the court. Here the opposing faction personalities
may bring to bear their own political power in support or opposition of the vote, or simply to abstain (which may result
in loss of standing), and if the Monarch feels the balance is swinging too far away from his own stance, he will intervene.
This is a series of events that effect all characters in the realm, and over the course of a few month debate period the
argument may escalate to civil war, or fizzle out. Only one of these major debates may occur every few years, with a longer
cooldown period for the specific issue raised.

MONARCH ACTIONS
All actions that the Monarch does, in support of a minor lordling, in regards to Orlais, if they do something unexpected,
if they were to do something unkingly, is potentially reacted to by the 12 other Tracked Characters. This is dampened by
the Monarch's Authority or Popularity, or the support of a Faction Leader, and maintaining good relations with the realm
will allow the Monarch much freedom to act as they wish.

REGAL SUCCESSION
During life, the King designates an heir apparent, usually his firstborn, and depending on how low
his Authority may be, he may be pushed to changing that to one more pleasing a particular Faction Leader
	
IF: The designated heir inherits, and no-one makes a move to replace them with another, they are crowned quickly.
	
IF: The designated heir inherits, but someone is unhappy with the choice, then it goes to debate and the crowning is
delayed or the issue is possibly put to a bannorn wide vote between the best candidates. The resulting winner is quickly
crowned.

IF: The designated heir inherits, and someone objects enough to violence, then the debate quickly turns into desperate
plots to possess the King or the loyalty of his men, and eventually turns to Civil War or a humiliating backing off and
punishing to the losing party.

In the case of no King being selected formally, then the 'King' is not titled as such, merely: "Designated Heir" or
similar, and if replaced they lose all but the claim. In the case of the 'King' being backed in a civil war, they are
Crowned informally, but gain the title until deposed.
