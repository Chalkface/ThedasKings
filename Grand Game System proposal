GRAND GAME SYSTEM

"There have been three wars this year fought over elopements. Five fought over wool. And one started by an apple tree.
It isn't even winter yet. Who would believe that these same banns, now trying so hard to kill one another, just last
year united to give me the crown?"
  - Queen Fionne of Ferelden, 6:18 Steel Age


The Grand Game System covers political interactions between baron, count and duke level characters - it basically
refers to all political actions below the required attention of the Monarch. Through this system the lower tier player
will be immersed but not overwhelmed in the machinations and attentions of all other lords and determine their level of
engagement in petty politics. Simultaniously the system must provide a backdrop that implies a bustling and constant
political life that keeps the player immersed, and provide the player with a few key characters to focus their intrigue
on. It is also the starting point of aquiring gold and prestige, and a place to invest those currencies as they are
earnt - allowing the player to progress into power gradually without having to take more dangerous risks.

To this end, the focus is upon:
  The Friends and Rivals system, to provide familiar faces in most cases for allies and opponents.
  Extended interpersonal relations, more potential ++ and more potential -- to shape the scenario dynamically.
  Gaining minor titles, winning petty wars, and humiliating rivals for prestige.
  Events that transform gold into prestige.
  The use of Plots to accomplish all of this, rather than Decisions.
  Give the player a semi dangerous game to play, to replace emphasis on low level wars of conquest.

Here are the primary tools to build events for this system, though obviously many others could be used in events.
